A session begins with a NIKON UNIT INQUIRY, a series ofcommand and data packets in quick succession, folled by a SignoffPacket.  example: read in a list of settings, show them on the host, andthen change individual settings would be broken up into a single sessionfor reading all options, and then possibly multiple sessions forchanging individual settings.See the examples document for some examples of a session.
